# img playaround

With my interest in GANs soaring as of recently, I have been curious about how certain image processing algorithms work, and whether I could implement them. So, finally, I got around actually trying, practicing, experimenting and in general having fun with the aforementioned algorithms. This repo will contain my experiments with these algorithms, including some relevant tasks I had to do for university.
